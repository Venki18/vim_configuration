# vim_configuration

This repository contains a `.vimrc` configuration file for the vim setup that I like to use. This includes:

* No tabs by default, but spaces

* Can `ESC` with `jk` or `kj`

* Relative line number

* Use same register as regular clipboard by default

* Show `$` at the end of each line and `^I` for tabs to more easily check code consistency with white space

The basic structure comes from http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Example_vimrc, which gave me a great starting point to customize my vim use.
